[A] Emoji
---------

An emoji [絵文字] is a graphical character. Emoji may be used as icons
embedded within strings of text, as individual images, or as digital
“stamps” or “stickers” embedded within digital content or messages. Each
emoji contains one or more code. Codes may be individual character codes
in encoding sets such as, but not limited to: Unicode, UTF-8 and
Shift-JIS. Other forms of codes may be names or identifying words or
strings of text, often enclosed in “escape” characters, most commonly
colons “:”. Emoji data is not limited to images and codes, each emoji
may contain a variety of extended data such as copyright, license,
author, URL, animation information, sounds, variants, extended data
payloads, extended information hashes, tags, categories, details, etc.

emojidex defines three types of emoji:

UTF emoji: UTF emoji are emoji which have been defined and given
distinct character codes within the Unicode standard. UTF emoji may also
be referred to as “standard emoji”. UTF emoji will almost invariably
contain a UTF-8 character code and distinct U+ character code. UTF emoji
are not wrapped in escape characters to designate they are emoji.

Extended emoji: Extended emoji are emoji that are created by the
emojidex project and to which the emojidex project holds all rights and
copyright. Extended emoji are covered in emojidex Licenses along with
UTF emoji.

User emoji: User emoji are emoji that have been submitted to the
emojidex service by general users and 3rd parties. emojidex will not
hold the copyright to the majority of these emoji, and emojidex licenses
do not grant copyright privileges on these emoji. Utilization and rights
to User emoji are covered in the emojidex Terms of Service.

4. Full emojidex Service Utilization
====================================

In order to fully utilize the emojidex service, the following conditions
must be met:

-   All emoji base information and assets must be obtained from the
    emojidex service and content delivery network.
-   When possible, assets must be cached to reduce traffic to the
    emojidex content delivery network.
-   All assets must be periodically checked to determine if there are
    newer versions of those assets on the emojidex Service or content
    delivery network. Checksums should be used to compare locally cached
    emoji to those available on the emojidex service. Checks should be
    performed at least once every 72 hours or the first time a client is
    run after a 72 hour period for User emoji. A similar check should be
    performed and at least once every 10 days for UTF and Extended
    emoji. The generally accepted way of checking for newer versions of
    emoji assets will be with MD5 sum, which can be obtained through the
    emojidex API.
-   Seed emoji may be distributed with a package or project when they
    are required for the interface or operation of that package or
    project before updated assets may be obtained. In this situation
    these seed assets must be checked and replaced with newer versions
    of the emoji used as seeds as quickly as possible.
-   Links to, and/or notices must be made clearly visible to users that
    emoji assets are being obtained from emojidex must exist somewhere
    within the package or project. These notices and/or links may be
    nested in About screens, online-help, settings screens or other
    locations not constantly visible or visible while using or
    displaying emoji.
-   If it is possible to turn emoji images into hyperlinks on the
    platform being used, emoji used as stamps or icons within text must
    be made into hyperlinks when a URL attribute is present for that
    emoji.
-   emoji obtained from the emojidex Service may not be replaced with
    alternative versions. All emoji displayed to a user must be the
    emoji obtained from the emojidex Service.
-   Copyright information, URLs and other auxiliary information
    associated with emoji must never be replaced or altered.
-   emoji graphical assets and indexes may be filtered / black or white
    listed / blocked for content such that these emoji will not be
    displayed or appear in search results. When filtered these emoji
    will not be displayed and no alternative emoji or image will be
    displayed in their place; either the code must be displayed as plain
    text or redacted entirely.
-   A reasonable effort must be made to minimize traffic to the emojidex
    Service and content delivery networks. Consecutive queries in very
    short periods of times should be avoided. Pre-caching of emojidex
    assets should be kept to a reasonable minimum. If your application
    or client is found to be over-utilizing the API or content delivery
    networks you may be charged for that usage.
-   emoji image assets obtained from the emojidex Service may be
    cosmetically altered if said cosmetic alteration is uniform and does
    not violate copyright. Examples of acceptable alterations are
    applying image filtering, altering or removing colors, blurring,
    applying mosaics, applying bevels, applying shadows, adding
    movement, adding effects such as particles, and applying transition
    animations.
